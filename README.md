# From Raw Data To Intelligent Predictions v2

Forecasting Model Evolution: A Case Study in Diagnostics and Resolution
This repository documents the evolution of a time-series forecasting project for electricity demand. More importantly, it details the diagnostic process undertaken when a theoretically superior model underperformed, and the implementation of a rigorous comparison protocol to achieve a definitive, reproducible result.

**1. The Challenge: When a "Better" Model Performs Worse**
The journey to evolve the initial V1 model (univariate Conv1D) to a more advanced V2 (hybrid multivariate Conv1D-LSTM) presented a counter-intuitive challenge: the theoretically superior model was producing inconsistent and often worse results.
This triggered a diagnostic process to uncover the root cause, revealing that a fair and rigorous comparison framework is the most critical pillar of any successful machine learning project.

**2. The Solution: Implementing a Rigorous Comparison Protocol**
To resolve the inconsistencies, the entire experimentation pipeline was standardized. The key was to ensure both models competed under identical conditions, eliminating any variables that could bias the outcome.
 * Identical Task: Both V1 and V2 models were set to predict the same task: a single future time step.
 * Identical Data: A fixed 80/20 data split was implemented. The preprocessing pipeline was corrected to prevent data leakage, ensuring the MinMaxScaler was fit only on training data.
 * Reproducibility: A random seed (seed = 42) was set across NumPy, random, and TensorFlow to ensure results were stable and consistent across every run.
   
**3. The Validated Result: V2 Proves Its Superiority**
With a fair protocol in place, the results finally aligned with the theory. The V2 model (hybrid multivariate) demonstrated its clear superiority, validating that a more complex architecture, when implemented correctly, leads to significantly higher accuracy.
Quantitative Results
The metrics confirm the visual evidence. The V2 model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 382.18, a massive 78.5% improvement over V1's MAE of 1,778.74. Similarly, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was reduced by 22.75% (from 355,109.59 to 274,315.58), indicating that the V2 model makes far fewer large, costly errors.

**4. Lessons Learned & The Roadmap to V3**
A key finding emerged when adding Feature Engineering (time-based features) to the validated V2 architecture: performance collapsed. This was not a failure, but a crucial diagnostic insight: the current V2 architecture lacked the capacity to handle the increased data complexity. This learning defines the clear path forward for a V3.
 * 1. Powered-Up Architecture + Feature Engineering: Re-introduce cyclical features (sin/cos for hour/day) but with a model of greater capacity (more filters, neurons, and Dropout layers) to process them effectively.
 * 2. Attention Mechanisms: Implement an Attention layer to allow the model to dynamically weigh the importance of past data, focusing only on the most relevant information for each prediction.
 * 3. Scientific Optimization: Use tools like KerasTuner or Optuna for a systematic search of the best hyperparameters, maximizing performance.
 * 4. Probabilistic Forecasting: Shift from predicting a single point to a confidence interval (e.g., a 95% range), which is immensely more valuable for business risk management.
